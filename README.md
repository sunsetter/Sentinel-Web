Sentinel Web
============

Server monitoring tool

Sentinel is a small server monitoring application which gets local system data like CPU and RAM usage, 
free disk space, and sends it to a Sentinel website, where it can be displayed in detail.
Sentinel consists of two components: the Sentinel server agent, that gathers system information, 
and the Sentinel website, where the agent sends all gathered logs.

System information is sent by Sentinel agent tool, which is written in Java and
can be installed on any platform, such as MacOS, Windows, Linux, Unix, etc.
After Sentinel agent tool gets system information, it sends data to a Sentinel Web.
